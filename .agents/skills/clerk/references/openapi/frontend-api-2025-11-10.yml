  title: Clerk Frontend API
  version: v1
  description: |-
    The Clerk REST Frontend API, meant to be accessed from a browser or native environment.

    This is a Form Based API and all the data must be sent and formatted according to the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.

    ### Versions

    When the API changes in a way that isn't compatible with older versions, a new version is released.
    Each version is identified by its release date, e.g. `2021-02-05`. For more information, please see [Clerk API Versions](https://clerk.com/docs/backend-requests/versioning/overview).

    ### Using the Try It Console

    The `Try It` feature of the docs only works for **Development Instances** when using the `DevBrowser` security scheme.
    To use it, first generate a dev instance token from the `/v1/dev_browser` endpoint.

    Please see https://clerk.com/docs for more information.

  /oauth/register:
    post:
      summary: Register OAuth 2.0 Client
      description: |-
        Registers a new OAuth 2.0 client with the authorization server according to RFC 7591
        (OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol).

        This endpoint allows clients to dynamically register by submitting client metadata.
        Upon successful registration, the authorization server assigns a unique client identifier
        and optionally a client secret (for confidential clients).

        **Authentication:** This endpoint does not require authentication as it is used for
        initial client registration. However, the endpoint is disabled by default and must
        be enabled in the Instance settings.

        **Client Types:**
        - **Confidential clients** receive both a `client_id` and `client_secret`
        - **Public clients** (using `token_endpoint_auth_method: none`) receive only a `client_id`

        **Key Points:**
        - All dynamically registered clients must use the consent screen (cannot be disabled)
        - PKCE is not required for dynamically registered clients
        - The `redirect_uris` field is required and must contain at least one valid redirect URI
        - If `client_name` is not provided, the `client_id` will be used as the display name
        - If `scope` is not provided, default scopes will be assigned
        - The `token_endpoint_auth_method` values `client_secret_basic` and `client_secret_post` are
          treated equivalently in the current implementation; both methods can be used at the
          token endpoint

        See [RFC 7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591) for complete specification details.

        Exchange an authorization grant for OAuth2 tokens (access token, refresh token, and optionally ID token).

        This endpoint implements the OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint (RFC 6749) and OpenID Connect token endpoint.
        It supports two grant types: `authorization_code` and `refresh_token`.

        #### Grant Types

        - **`authorization_code`**: Exchange an authorization code for tokens
        - **`refresh_token`**: Refresh an access token using a refresh token

        #### Authentication

        - **Confidential clients**: Must authenticate using one of the following methods:
          - HTTP Basic Authentication: `Authorization: Basic base64(client_id:client_secret)`
          - Client credentials in request body: Include `client_id` and `client_secret` in form fields
          - *Note: Both methods (`client_secret_basic` and `client_secret_post`) are treated equivalently*
        - **Public clients** (PKCE flow): No client secret required. Must provide `client_id` and `code_verifier` in request body.

        #### PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

        Public clients and clients that cannot securely store a client secret must use PKCE (RFC 7636).
        When using PKCE:
        - Include `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method` in the authorization request
        - Include `code_verifier` in the token request (instead of `client_secret`)

        #### Scopes

        Available scopes:
        - `openid` - Enables OpenID Connect features, returns an `id_token` in the response
        - `email` - User's email address
        - `profile` - Basic profile information (name, username, picture, etc.)
        - `public_metadata` - Clerk custom scope for public metadata
        - `private_metadata` - Clerk custom scope for private metadata

        Default scopes (if not specified): `email profile`

        #### Token Lifespans

        - **Access token**: 1 day (86400 seconds)
        - **Refresh token**: 10 years
        - **ID token**: 1 day (86400 seconds)
        - **Authorization code**: 10 minutes (must be exchanged within this time)

        #### OpenID Connect

        When the `openid` scope is included in the authorization request, the token response will include
        an `id_token` field containing a signed JWT with user identity information per the OpenID Connect specification.
        The `id_token` will be refreshed along with the access token when using the `refresh_token` grant type.

      summary: Create a new Sign In or replace the current one.
      description: |-
        Creates or replaces the current Sign in object.
        In order to authenticate a Sign in in as few requests as possible,
        you can pass in parameters to this request that can identify and verify the Sign in.

        Parameter rules:

        If the strategy equals `phone_code`, `email_code`, `web3_[provider]_signature`, `reset_password_code` or `reset_password_phone_code` then an identifier is required.

        If the strategy equals `email_link` then an identifier is required and optionally redirect_url can be supplied.

        If the strategy equals `password` then both an identifier and a password is required.

        If the strategy equals `oauth_[provider]` or `saml` then a redirect_url is required, and an action_complete_redirect_url is optional.

        If the strategy equals `oauth_token_[provider]` then at least one of code (grant code) or token (openID token) is required. Passing only the token will probably retrieve minimal information about the user from the OAuth provider. You can pass both code and token for the best results.

        If the strategy equals `ticket` then ticket is required.

        If the strategy equals `passkey` then no identifier is provided.

        If the strategy equals `google_one_tap` then token is required.

        Requires the sign in attempt to be identified, and the first factor verification to be prepared, unless you're using a password.

        Parameter rules:
        If the strategy equals `email_code` or `phone_code` then a code is required.
        If the strategy equals `password` then a password is required.

        enabling cookie sync to the app domain in a single step. This is useful for browser
        automation tools (Puppeteer, Playwright) that need cookies on the application domain.

            Before redirecting, the URL is validated:
            - Must be a valid absolute URL with an `https` scheme in production.
              In development instances, `http` is also permitted.
            - The URL's domain must belong to one of the instance's associated domains
              (primary or satellite).

            In production, the handshake payload is set as a cookie.
            In development, the handshake payload is passed as a query parameter.
